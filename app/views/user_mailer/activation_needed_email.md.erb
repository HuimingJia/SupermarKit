# Get Those Groceries.

Welcome to the community <%= @user.name %>. Our goal here is to make your grocery shopping *simpler*, and *better*.

## Take a Look
SupermarKit allows you to make grocery lists using the many items that other members have already created and refined. This makes it easier to get what you want at the right place and for an accurate price.
All the items available to use on your lists in SupermarKit are created by the community.

## Bring Your Friends
We're all about the group experience here at SupermarKit, and that's why we have Kits. Kits hold your grocery lists for certain people and events. When you make your Kit, everyone you add
will be able to make changes to the grocery lists and all Kit members can be emailed your prepared list when you're ready to go out and get your groceries.

## Let Us Know
Don't take our word for it, [confirm your account on SupermarKit](<%= activate_user_url(@user.activation_token) %>) and let us know what you think. If there is anything that we could do to make your grocery shopping experience more enjoyable, we encourage you to reply to our email or check out our about page to get in touch.

From all of us at SupermarKit, keep your shelves full and your fridge spotless fellow shopper.
